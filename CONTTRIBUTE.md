### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Chrono? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/Shu-AFK/chrono/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/Shu-AFK/chrono/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
